1. INTRODUCTION

This modern period of science has been described as the post-genomic era, where 
all available sources of information are explored at the biological systems 
level. This is in stark contrast to the older genocentric view, which sought to 
describe simple links connecting individual genes to particular phenotypes. 
Considering then the many genes which may contribute to disease, it is unders-
tandable that modern attempts to associate phenotypes with genetic variations 
do so on a genomic scale, using interactome, especially in the case of complex 
diseases, such as cancer, tuberculosis, etc.

In the context of post-analysis approach in biology, we are developing tools 
that can ease the analyses of these genes or proteins and the retrieval of 
related information of these genes/proteins, including:
  (1) Identifying and ranking genes or proteins associated with biological 
  experiments, 
  (2) Retrieving biological processes most pertinent to the biological 
  experiments, 
  (3) Describing and characterizing the structure of protein datasets and 
  elucidating protein orgene set patterns in order to improve biological 
  interpretation.
More specificlly, to improve the process of Protein function prediction, candi-
date gene or target prediction and prioritization, post genome-wide association 
analyses, prediction of disease phenotype trends, and identification of disease 
related genetic patterns or properties.

The post-analysis tools is free software distributed under a GNU-style copyleft.

These tools are freely downloadable under GNU General Public License (GPL), pre-
compiled for Linux version and protected by copyright laws, a free software and

This directory contains different libraries and packages implemenetd in the 
context of post-analysis tools, entirely in the Python programming language, 
versions >= 2.7. These different tools are developed under the leadership of 
Gaston K. Mazandu, who regularly updates the information available in this 
package and makes every effort to ensure the quality of this information.

2. HISTORY

The post-analysis-tools development was initially written by Gaston K. Mazandu
of the Sickle Africa Data Coordinating Center (SADaCC) project in the Depart-
ment Pathology, Division of Human Genetics at the University of Cape Town. In 
addition, a large group of individuals is contributing to post-analysis-tools 
by sending suggestions and bug reports.

Since mid-2015 there has been a core group who worked on initial core of the
post-analysis-tools code archive.

This file has been minimally revised since the release of the A-DaGO-Fun tool
in 2015

3. PRESENT STATUS

The present version implements two main objects, critical to post-analyses:

- Integrated Human Protein-Protein Interaction Network Generator: IHP-PING 
- Python library implementing Semantic Similarity Measures [Library]: PySML

All the post-analysis-tools functions and methods have been documented in a  PDF 
manual, providing a more user-friendly starting point on admininstration and 
usage.
